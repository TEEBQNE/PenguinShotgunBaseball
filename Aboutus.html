  It starts with a dream. Work hard enough and a dream can become a reality. 
  Six individuals got together because they love the Dover area, they believe the community has tremendous potential, 
  and they know a lot about the hospitality industry. Their efforts will come to fruition this weekend as they open a new deli, 
  restaurant, and saloon that is friendly, comfortable, and feels like home. This was the header to a magazine article 35 years 
  ago when TC’s Family Restaurant first opened its doors.

  TC’s Family Restaurant, located on Route 100, is a community restaurant and deli offering lunch, dinner, ate night snacks, 
  and drinks. A number of people are behind the new restaurant and deli. They are dedicated to the Mount Snow area and they share an 
  interest in the revitalization of Dover.

 The idea began when Mount Snow Market Place property owner Adam Levine was searching for a new anchor tenant. Levine was 
 looking into the economic needs of the Mount Snow region and he believed the area was in need of a new eating and dining establishment. 
 Levine said the Deerfield Valley is showing signs of economic improvement and the Dover community has been supportive in attracting new 
 businesses to the valley.

 As a result, Levine thought it was time to try something new. He credits the selectboard, the Dover Economic Development Committee, 
 and the Tri-town Economic Development Committee with creating a business climate that allows small businesses to get off the ground. 
 “Mount Snow is showing signs of promise. I also believe risk has been minimized to invest in Dover today. The community is being proactive in 
 making things happen in the valley. That’s why I and a couple of partners have chosen to do this,” said Levine.

Levine developed a business plan for a new food establishment. He got together with Doug Gerber, owner and proprietor of the New Smith Street 
Deli in Merrick, NY, Ken Teich, a former co-worker from Wilmington, and Rob DeLeo, owner of Deli Design in Copaige, NY, and they formed Handlebar 
Hospitality LLC. “There are a number of owners and I pulled a team together,” said Levine. The owners developed a Valley View Saloon business plan 
and agreed to hand over the day-to-day operations to two individuals. Luckily, they have did not to go far to find the right people for the job.

The Valley View Saloon will offer a variety of foods. The deli will feature hot and cold sandwiches, including build-your-own heroes, Philly 
cheese steaks, wraps, burgers, soups, salads, and their original chili with melted cheddar, the Valley View Saloon specialty. The Valley View Saloon 
will have outdoor seating along the Deerfield River, offer weekend entertainment, billiards, and eight beers on tap. “It’s hard to find a meal before 
4 pm and after 9 pm. We’re trying to fill that gap,” said Demers.
