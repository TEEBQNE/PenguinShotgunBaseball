      <h2>Senior Capstone Post 1 | On Boarding</h2>
      <h5>Tyler Chapman, Jan, 20, 2020</h5>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first semester of my senior year, I 
      worked on a game my team of 5 titled Vacuum Vault. To explain briefly what the game is about, 
      it is a level based treasure hunter where the player uses a vacuum gun to terraform the world, 
      rebuild broken structures, and engage with the environment to unlock treasures hidden within the vault. 
      If you would like to see a short trailer of the game, click on the video below.</p>

	<p>At the end of my first semester, my school put both 
	my team and the other 22 teams in my class through a process they call cuts. In this process, a 
	team of representatives made up mainly of divisions heads of our game development school voted on 
	which games they thought should go through to the following semester. My teamâ€™s game was one of the 
	8 games to be put through! After the deliberations, we then moved onto drafts to see which classmates 
	would be coming onto our team. Our team grew from a small team of 5 to a much larger team of 16. After our 
	new team was assembled, we all left for Winter break for holiday. Once back, we started our onboarding process 
	for all our new team members. 
	</p>
	
<p>To assure that all of our team members were comfortable with our team, we established a 
team culture, workflow and set up a basic schedule. We then defined two distinct teams, one termed 
content and the other team systems. The content team would mainly focus on new implementations, mainly level 
creation, and future features. This team consisted of artists and designers. The systems team is concentrated on 
creating tools that the content team can use whether that be architecture for programmers or tools for artists/designers. 
I am on the systems team, mainly focusing on improving my implementation of marching cubes. If you are unfamiliar with 
marching cubes, it is an algorithm to allow a player to terraform a mesh in realtime. I am currently working on making 
my implementation more efficient to allow for a larger mesh to be generated while maintaining a consistent 60 fps refresh rate.
</p>

<p>Some ideas I had to do this were to move all of the complex calculations to the GPU by using 
a compute shader. This will allow the CPU to handle the rest of our game, keeping the CPU usage down 
whenever marching cubes are going to be used. My other idea of how to optimize it would be to put all 
of the calculations in a C++ DLL and multithread it. I am not too familiar with multithreading with C++ 
and am unsure if this will really improve our frame usage. An issue with the compute shader solution is that 
I am by no means a graphics programmer, and have little to no experience with compute shaders. If I am to attempt this, 
I will either need to do a lot of research or ask the help of a fellow classmate or teacher to assist in its progress. 
I hope to get marching cubes working in a singular mesh over our entire level so that level designers can have 
an easier time forming terrain. If I am unable to accomplish this, the level design will prove rather difficult. 
</p>

<p>If I can fix the frame issue, I continue my work by updating the frontend portion of marching 
cubes, extending the functionality for artists and designers to utilize the algorithm. Some examples
 that I might be adding are geometry editing brushes to sculpt the terrain more uniformly, a smoothing
  tool to give the terrain a more realistic look, splitting drop tables by chunk instead of by mesh for
   more diverse drops over the entire map and creating a way for certain portions of the map to be 
   uneditable to give the designers more versatility to their creations.
   </p>

<p>
As for the rest of my team, a majority of them are new team members, so they are mainly focusing 
on getting acquainted with our game, the art style, the codebase and any other relevant information
 that they will need to work on our game. For the programmers, most of their tasks are focused 
 on looking into our project and getting familiar with existing systems. Aside from that, other 
 takes are unrelated to touching code, but to research future optimizations such as object pooling to 
 further improve the performance of our game. Artists focused on concepting and understanding our current 
 art direction. Designers learned how to use our existing tool, gave input for future tools and wrote out 
 docs to have a plan in place for our games end goal.  Our next sprint will focus more on implementation 
 once everyone has a good understanding of where we are now. 
 </p>
 
 <p>
 One large issue that we as a team faced last semester with our game is that we had no narration or 
 direction for the player to follow. Gaining numerous designers, we were able to put a story to our current
 features. It is not finalized yet but the preliminary pitch is that your grandfather was apart of a legendary
 treasure-hunting group, and one day he went missing on one of his voyages. As you are digging through his
 old belongings, you find a box marked for you that contains a new model of a vacuum gun that your grandfather
 was known to use. As you gradually understand how to utilize the vacuum, you set out on a quest to find what
 happened to your grandfather. Along the way, you find hints and clues either to unlock new abilities in the
 game or to discover where your grandfather is. As it is still in development the story is subject to large
 changes, but this is the first agreed-upon story that fits our existing game. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
  I am rather excited to continue development on our game with a larger team, especially as this is the largest
  team I will have worked on so far. I hope that I can figure out a way to get marching cubes to a point where it 
  seamlessly fits into gameplay with minimal frame dropping and that it is an easy tool to use to create levels.
  Future development posts should be more exciting with gifs of progress, possible code snippets and whatever
  else I can fit into the git repo that hosts this website.
