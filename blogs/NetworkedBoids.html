      <h2>Networked flocking boids</h2>
      <h5>Tyler Chapman, Nov, 2, 2018</h5>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am currently enrolled in a Networking class and an Artificial Intelligence (AI) class this semester. I just finished an assignment combining work from both classes. In our AI class, we learned about Craig Reynolds who in 1986 developed boids, which are AI specifically designed to replicate the flocking behavior of birds. To achieve this flocking behavior, each boid has a set of simple rules to follow and adhere to depending on the current situation it is in. Each of these rules are different steering components that are combined together to get the end result of what looks to be a flock of boids. The steering components that makeup flocking are as follows:
		</p>
<strong><p align = "center">Separation:</strong> Steers to avoid overcrowding boids in its immediate vicinity</p>

<strong><p align = "center">Alignment:</strong> Steers towards the average direction of boids in its immediate vicinity</p>

<strong><p align = "center">Cohesion:</strong> Steers toward the average position (center of mass) of boids in its immediate vicinity</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason each of the steering components ends with ‘immediate vicinity’ is because in my implementation, each component has a radius of effect, where they only take into account the other boids in this area. This allows there to be multiple flocks occurring at the same time instead of there being one large flock.
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of these steering components produces either a velocity or acceleration (one or the other not both) depending on what you want the behavior to look like. The results are sent to a flocking component which calculates the end velocity or acceleration. Most flocking implementations also use weights. Each steering component listed above would have an assigned weight, generally ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. These weights specify how much the flocking component should listen to each steerings output. In order to get a good looking flocking, I had to change the weights around quite a bit. 
	</p>

<!--<Have gif of non networking flocking>-->

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the AI part out of the way, it was now time for networking! In my networking class, we had just learned of three different data models, which were: data push, data share and data couple. To make it easier to explain them, i’ll use flocking in each explanation.</p>

<p> <strong>Data push:</strong> For this implementation, the flocking calculations are done on the server, then each client receives the position and direction data to draw each boid on screen. This means that all calculations are done on the server and all rendering is done by the client after receiving the data. The reason that this looks exactly like the local simulation is because it is! Due to how the data is being handled, the only difference between the local simulation and data push is where the calculations are happening.</p>

<h4 align = "center"> Data push in action</h4>
<img src="imgs/dataPush.gif"></img>

<p> <strong>Data share:</strong> For this implementation, the flocking and rendering are done by each client. The server does not do any calculations here but has a completely different task. It will receive the boids of each connected client and then send the pertinent information off to the other clients connected. This allows every client to draw the other clients boids, but these boids do not interact with one another, they are just drawn on top of each other. This means that if one client disconnects or the packet sending is interrupted, the boids of this client will freeze on all the other client's screens. This can be seen when I hold each window. The non-local boids on the non-held window freeze due to that window not sending any data to the server, so the other client has no updated states to draw. To visually make it easier, I also colored the non-local boids black to distinguish them better from the local boids.</p>

<h4 align = "center"> Data share in action</h4>
<img src="imgs/dataShare.gif"></img>

<p> <strong>Data couple:</strong> For this implementation, the flocking simulation is run both on the server and client. The rendering is still only done on the client side. When the server receives any new boids in the packet it receives, it will add these boids to its existing flock, simulate this flock once, then send this back to each client. The clients will then add these boids to their flock if they do not exist, then simulate the flock and send this data back to the server. Unlike data share, this means that all boids interact with one another as if they are all stored locally. When I hold a window this time, the non-local boids on the other screen do not freeze, they simply continue to simulate. When the window that was held is released, its state is updated to the most current state the server has access to. Again, I colored the non-local boids black to make it easier to distinguish the boids. There is noticeable latency issues with this implementation which is expected. I will improve upon this implementation at a later date by using a technique called dead reckoning to fix the rubber banding affect that is occurring.</p>

<p>I had quite a bit of fun with both creating flocks and then networking them. While I might not necessarily use flocking in any of my future games, it was a good base to help me understand the three different data models I learned about in my networking class. If you have any questions regarding my implementation <a href = "Contact">contact me</a> and I will be happy to help!</p></div>
