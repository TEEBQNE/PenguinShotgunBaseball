    <div class = "penguinAbout"><p>Penguin Shotgun Baseball was my first game created with other game division members. </br>
   The restriction we had when designing the game is that we were only permitted to use a single input </br>
   for all controls in the game. It was a fun challenge to detect various inputs from the one key based on timing. </br>
   I only worked on this game for about a week and a half. Depending on my schedule I might return to it to fix </br>
   the couple bugs that arose and push it to a mobile market. Click the image above to play it!</p></div>

    <div class = "penguinAbout"><p>Don't be Afraid of the Dark was my next game. The restrictions for this game were a bit different than the first.</br>
    For this game, we had to base it around a particular color. Our color was white. As well, we had to target this game at 
    </br>a non conventional audience. Our game is targeted at younger kids who are afraid of the dark and want to over</br>
     come this fear. My group did substantial research to find what should go in a game like this. I had a lot of fun coming up with</br>
    the various mechanics that went into it and am glad with how it turned out. I especially like the way the glow sticks</br>
    look and feel. Click the image above to play it!</p></div>

    <div class = "penguinAbout"><p>This game is rather complex. The current build that is uploaded here is the prototype I</br>
    made in the first week of development. The actual game can not be uploaded as it is networked using UNet which is </br>
    incompatible with WebGL to upload it here. The full game is a co-op networked tower defense top down shooter that </br>
    incorporates an alternative screen using an LCD monitor with the polarizing screen strip out, and a tablet as an </br>
    alternative controller. One player plays the tower defense using the tablet as their controller, and place </br>
    polarizing tiles on the LCD monitor to expand their vision. The other player uses an Xbox controller</br>
    and has complete vision of the LCD monitor using glasses that have polarizing filters as lenses. </br>
    The tower defense player places turrets on the tablet. They can upgrade the turrets, change the </br>
    targeting of the turrets or sell the turrets. Anything that they do on the networked tablet </br>
    will change on the game on the LCD monitor. The tower defense player places these turrets to </br>
    destroy the in lane enemies while the bullet hell player shoots the flying out of lane enemies. Player 2 <br>
    must dodge bullets, collect resources for Player 1 to use and kill enemies so they do not fly into the </br>
    tower defense base, making the base lose health. As the rounds go on, the tower defense player unlocks </br>
    new turrets. If at any time Player 2 takes damage or dies, Player 1 can heal them or revive them for </br>
    resources. After a certain amount of rounds, a boss spawns. This boss can be hit by both Player 1 and </br>
    Player 2. Once they defeat this boss, the game is won. If I am to continue developing this </br>
    game, I would add different zones where once a boss is killed, the players switch roles, then </br>
    move onto a new zone. Eventually they would reach a main boss and that would be the end of the game. </br>
    You are able to play the prototype version of the tower defense game by playing above. If you have any </br>
    interest in playing the game, send me an e-mail on the Contact Me tab and i'll happily </br>
    send you the game to run.</p></div>
