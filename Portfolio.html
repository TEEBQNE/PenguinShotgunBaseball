								Descent of Champions is a PvE competitive arena based brawler where players compete in
								combat based objects to win over the audiences favor. The audience is made up of live 
								spectators that tuned in from anywhere to influence the game by amassing in game currency
								and spending it on spawning enemies, game events and personalized emotes. Our game was nominated
								for the following 6 awards: Best Prototype, Best Art Direction, Best Technical Achievement, 
								Best Quality of the "3Cs" and the Audience Award. <span>We won the award Best Integration of the theme</span>.
								Our team put in over 2000 hours in 10 weeks and we would do it again to produce a game just as awesome
								as Descent of Champions.

								Blind Fire is a networked co-op top down shooter and tower defense game. One player uses an Android tablet to 
								play the tower defense game while the other player uses a PC with the polarizing filter stripped out
								using glasses with polarizing film in them. The tablet player can not see most of the map tiles
								as removing the polarizing film from a PC makes the image unseeable. The two players had to work together 
								in order to defeat all the mobs and keep their base alive. I made this game as my final project in my
								sophomore year. It was the first game I networked a game, using UNet which is now deprecated. Even though the game
								is rather complex and confusing, I had a blast making it.

								This Hoogan's Alley clone was created in C++ using the SDL library for low level input and graphics libraries.
								All other systems such as collision, UI, basic gameloop, etc. were implemented by me. As the game is a clone, it
								plays the same as the original Hoogan's Alley. If you are unfamiliar, the player has 9 lives and must shoot all mobsters
								within a certain time for that round. If they are able to do so, they gain points to their total score. If they miss a 
								mobster or hit a civilian, they get minus 1 to their lives. Even though this game was simpler than my other projects, it was interesting
								to program my own engine to see what potentially goes into the engines I use.

								This network debugging tool was created for a networking final in my junior year with one other classmate.
								Our objective was to make a tool that we could use during QA of any of our future Unity projects. Generally during QA, we 
								would have builds of our games so we could not access any data in the game if something went wrong. With
								our tool, you can track variables indefinitely or within a threshold and have them sent to a host server
								to have the information stored. When I get freetime, I plan on expanding on this tool to have a more robust frontend
								interface for the results as well as track more data and even record active gameplay sections for accurate debugging.

				<p>The game was developed for the Ubisoft GameLab Competition in Montreal over a 10 week period. The competition 
				required that we fit the theme of a spectacle and that the game allowed a streaming audience watching the game be able to
				interact with the game, affecting gameplay.<br><br>
				
				Our approach to this mandate was a custom website built from the ground up to create a chat system, currency system to
				purchase in game goods to affect gameplay and to purchase other cosmetic in game items. With the exception of the Twitch
				embedded stream, the entire web component was developed solely by me.
